# evolution-simulator-2

The sequel to evolution-simulator (https://github.com/Phyrik/evolution-simulator).

evolution-simulator-2 is an evolution simulator that simulates (wow the word simulate is coming up a lot here) circular creatures with a certain vision and eating distance. They may eat, reproduce, kill, or some combination of the three each day.
